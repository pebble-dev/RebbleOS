// RebbleOS provides allocation functions.
#define JERRY_SYSTEM_ALLOCATOR 1
// System Allocation requires using full 32-bit pointers.
# define JERRY_CPOINTER_32_BIT 0

// RebbleOS works with soft-floats. In the interest of speed, JerryScript is told to use less precise 32-bit floats.
# define JERRY_NUMBER_TYPE_FLOAT64 0

// Rocky.js runs precompiled bytecode, rather than raw JS source.
# define JERRY_SNAPSHOT_EXEC 1
// This should save some flash since we don't need to parse JS source. Note: this breaks "eval".
# define JERRY_PARSER 0

// Needed to periodically handle events.
# define JERRY_VM_EXEC_STOP 1

// TODO: Evaluate the need for certain features and builtins, removing as necessary.
// TODO: Tune heap/stack/GC limits for better performance.
