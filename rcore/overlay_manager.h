 * @brief Overlay Windows management. You can create overlay windows over an app
 *
 * An \ref OverlayWindow is a special window that is drawn above a running app.
 * The memory and runtime of the \ref OverlayWindow are controlled away from the application
 * If you invoke one of these windows, expect little heap to play with.
 * 
 * You can create as many \ref OverlayWindow objects as you like, they will get stacked
 * like a normal window. In fact you can treat an \ref OverlayWindow as transparent
 * once you create one. Just deal with the underlying \ref Window object. You will know
 * with an assert if you do something that isn't allowed.
 * 
 * The \ref OverlayWindow has a child of a \ref Window object in it.
 * 
 * The window is isolated away from normal window functions, but please don't
 * try and push one of these windows into a normal apps running stack. It will break.
 * 
 * Window creation happens in a callback so we can delegate the work to our thread
 * and constrain memory and runtime of the window
